Typographia
===========

These are all of the files for "Typographia: An Urban-Alphabetic Exploration of Raleigh, NC." They include the downloadable content that is available in the published version as well as all of my working files for the compiled version. This project was published in the journal Kairos: A Journal of Technology, Rhetoric, and Pedagogy in the spring, 2010 (14.2). In 2011, it won "Best Webtext" by the journal. The code in the main swf, Typographia4, is a bit messy. It went through 'lots of rewrites and never got revised for readability, etc. Also, fyi, there is some AS3 code in the .fla file attached to various keyframes. This project uses the ModestMaps library, which let me interface with mapping apis at Google and Yahoo! The project can be found at:
